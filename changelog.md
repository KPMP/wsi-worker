# Changelog

## Release 1.4 [unreleased]
Brief summary of what's in this release:
- updated scripts to take in slide type information so that we can add non-svs images
- updated scripts to handle non-svs image pyramid building
- update scripts to take in any file extension

### Breaking changes

Breaking changes include any database updates needed, if we need to edit any files on system (like .env or certs, etc). Things that are outside of the code itself that need changed for the system to work.
- scripts require a new piece of information to determine what type of slide they are

### Non-breaking changes

Just a place to keep track of things that have changed in the code that we may want to pay special attention to when smoke testing, etc.
